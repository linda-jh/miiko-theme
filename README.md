## Dark theme for VS Code
Thank you for checking in my first theme! This is especially made with my own interests, but I hope that you like it as well. 

The colors in this theme are a little muddy and not anything too bright. My aim also was to make this theme useful for people with red-green color blindness and I am happy to take feed back and work on that more!

Fun fact: This theme is named after my cat!
