# Miiko Theme
## Dark theme for VS Code
Thank you for checking out my first theme! This is especially made with my own interests, but I hope that you like it as well. 

The colors in this theme are little muddy and not anything too bright. My aim also was to make this theme useful for people with red-green color blindness and I am happy to take feed back and work on that more!

**Fun fact:** This theme is named after my cat!
